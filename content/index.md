# LightJason

LightJason is a _lightwire multi-agent framework_ for creating a multi-agent system with Java. The project is inspired by [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net) but some new features are added to the framwork e.g.:

* lambda-expression
* explicit repair-planning
* multi-plan definition
* parallel execution and thread-safe variables
* multi-variable assignments

We are working on the theoretical background and developing the whole system with current software development technologies
