We will join the [EUMAS 2016](eumas-at2016.webs.upv.es/EUMAS2016.html) conference and present our current work. Right now we are within the testing-phase of LightJason's AgentSpeak(L++). Right now there exist some examples for various domains and applications: <!--more-->

* _Towers of Hanoi_ [ASL](https://github.com/LightJason/AgentSpeak/blob/master/src/test/resources/agent/hanoi.asl) and [Java class](https://github.com/LightJason/AgentSpeak/blob/master/src/test/java/org/lightjason/agentspeak/agent/IBaseHanoiTowers.java)
* [Pokemon-Scenario](https://github.com/flashpixx/RoutingSimulation) currently under development
* [Asimov](https://github.com/APTD/Simulation) our new research project
* A full documentation on the website is also still under construction (hope for finishing at the end of Jan 2017)
