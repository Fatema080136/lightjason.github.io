title: REST-API
news: [Feature]
---
We added a [REST-API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to control the agent execution structure and behaviour.<!--more--> The API is written with [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) and can be included into existing [Servlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet) structures. The component is written as a single add-on for our AgentSpeak(L++) agents and is located in its own [repository](https://github.com/LightJason/REST).
