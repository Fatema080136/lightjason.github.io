title: "Difference to Jason"
---

We describe the difference between LightJason and [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/), because in general the LightJason framework is inspired by Jason, but it is __not__:

* a copy of Jason
* a extension to Jason

LightJason does not use __any code fragments__ of Jason, so there is no connection between the two frameworks. LightJason is __only inspired__ by the concept of Jason on a theoretical level. We build a fully new framework from scratch.
