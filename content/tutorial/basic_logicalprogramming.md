title: "Basic Knowledge: Logical Programming"
---
This tutorial gives a short introduction in [logical programming concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming), which are needed to write the source code of an agent.

## Basic Information

On logical programms we are talking about a _symbolic definition_. We are writing source code in _symbols_, _facts_ and _rules_. The difference between [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) and a logical programm is, that we don't define _how the problem should be solved_. We define only the facts and rules which are needed to calculate the solution. In a more general way we define the _constraints_ which are needed to solve the problem. On this definition the runtime create an internal structure to solve the problem.

### Atom & Literals

The plainest structure of a logical programming language are _atoms_ and based on this structure the _literals_. For example:

> We would like to define that the sun is shining
> <pre><code class="prolog">sun( shining() ).</pre></code>
> The word ```sun``` and the word ```shining``` are _atoms_, the whole structure ```sun(shining())``` is named _literal_.

Another example is a time definition:

> We would like to say it is currently 2 a clock post meridiam (pm)
> <pre><code class="prolog">time( current( hour(2), minute(0), pm() ) ).</pre></code>
> You can see, that a literal can store a list of other literals or values inside the brackets.

Based on the first example a negation is also possible

> We would to say it is currently not raining
> <pre><code class="prolog">~raining().</pre></code>
> The tilde ```~``` in front of a atom defines the [strong negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_model_semantics#Strong_negation)
