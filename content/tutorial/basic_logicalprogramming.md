title: "Basic Knowledge: Logical Programming"
---
This tutorial gives a short introduction in [logical programming concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming), which are needed to write the source code of an agent.

## Basic Information

On logical programms we are talking about a _symbolic definition_. We are writing source code in _symbols_, _facts_ and _rules_. The difference between [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) and a logical programm is, that we don't define _how the problem should be solved_. We define only the facts and rules which are needed to calculate the solution. In a more general way we define the _constraints_ which are needed to solve the problem. On this definition the runtime create an internal structure to solve the problem.
