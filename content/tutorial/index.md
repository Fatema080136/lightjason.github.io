In this Section we introduce LightJason/AgentSpeak(L++) from a *hands-on* perspective by providing tutorials for understanding the practical applications of our framework.

Having [basic knowledge](/knowledgebase) about the [belief–desire–intention model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model) of multi-agent systems and understanding of logical programming concepts, i.e. [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), as well as Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) is helpful to follow our tutorials.


1. [AgentSpeak scenario in 15 minutes](tutorial-agentspeak-in-fifteen-minutes) a minimal example to build an agent scenario in 15 minutes from scratch with the current developer source codes
2. [Efficient Beliefbase](tutorial-efficient-beliefbase) is a tutorial for creating efficient beliefbase structures
3. [Environment](tutorial-environment) is a tutorial to create an environment, which is not nessessary on LightJason 
4. [Communication](tutorial-communication) is a tutorial to build communication, because LightJason does not support a build-in communication.
