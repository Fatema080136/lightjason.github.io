We would like to explain some tutorial stuff and basic knowldge about our framework. We recommand, that you have got expirence about the [belief–desire–intention model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model) of a multi-agent system, some programming concepts in a logical programming (similar to [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)) language and [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).

1. [Basic Knowledge: Logical Programming](basic-logicalprogramming) for understanding the difference to imperative programming. Explanation of the basic concepts for using this paradigm to describe the agent behaviour
2. [Basic Knowledge: Finite-State-Machine](basic-finitestatemachine) for understanding the runtime model of the agent behaviour
3. [Basic Knowledge: Finite-State-Machine & Logical Programming to an Agent](basic-fsm-logical-to-agent) to understand how we combine the parts into our agent definition
4. [Basic Knowledge: Agent scenario in 15 minutes](basic-agent-in-fifteen-minutes) a minimal example to build an agent scenario in 15 minutes from scratch with the current developer source codes
