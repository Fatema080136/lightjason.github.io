title: "Framework"
---
The multi-agent framework is split-up into different parts. Each component has got its own documentation, at this section we would like to give an overview over all elements within the framework. All frameworks are published to [Maven Central](htt://mvnrepository.com).

The source codes are written in Java (latest release version) with a defined syntax structure and all code documentation will be create with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). We are using also unit testing and the [Git-Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) developing model. 

__We hope for any assistance...__

This components defines the main agent structure. It defines the whole syntax and the base agent structure. It supports also an agent generator and configuration, so that you can create a set of agents by an ASL-file. Based on the interface structure you can redefine all elements if you want. A full [railroad diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) of your _AgentSpeak(L)_ syntax can be found on the documentation page.
