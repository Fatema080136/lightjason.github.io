title: "About"
---
This project arises during our PhD time, because our research is along [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system). Our research projects consider with _traffic_ and _crowd simulation_, but we try to simulation _complex manner of human behaviour_.

> Malte's research depends on _complex overtaking 
> manoeuvre_ and _norm usage_ with the on a high 
> abstraction level. The research contains a more 
> application based structure, but it is a gread and 
> helpful work, in which way a multi-agent system can 
> be used in complex simulation scenarios.

> Philipp's research is the _high scalability_ of such 
> complex simulation system also with data mining / big 
> data and software developing aspects. The thesis 
> contains a more algorithm, data structure, software 
> developing and formal structure. The software 
> building process is inspired by [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and 
> [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) to get a long live, robust 
> software architecture.

Based on these point of views we can amend our work.
Our work is inspired by [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/), a multi-agent framework, which is developed by Jomi F. HÃ¼bner and Rafael H. Bordini, but cannot ported for our requirements. We had tried a lot different types frameworks like [TerraME](http://www.terrame.org/), [FLAME](http://www.flame.ac.uk/), [GOAL](http://ii.tudelft.nl/trac/goal) or [MASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) to create an usable system for our simulation, but we cannot do so we build-up our framework from scratch. On another point of view we had compared the main _popular programming language indices_ [Tiobe](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2016/02/19/language-rankings-1-16/) and [PopularitY](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in 2015 / 2016 and we found out, that agent-programming is not listed on any index, only _logical programming (Prolog)_ is found on Tiobe.
Our goal for this system is to create a real usable and good supported framework, which can be used also from non-software-developer staff and real existing projects. We try to explain the ideas, concepts and technical background in a more clean and understandable way to get better approval of agent-programming and modeling.
