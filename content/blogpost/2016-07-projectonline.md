We have build the main website of the project, register the domain [lightjason.org](http://lightjason.org) <!--more--> and try to create the first full Maven package within the next weeks. We are working on a first example similar to the _Gold Miners_ scenario (see [JaCaMo](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/tutorial/gold-miners/)) but with OpenGL support with the Java [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) library. We are working on the project and the website continuously.
