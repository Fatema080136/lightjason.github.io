blogposts: [Feature]

We create a [REST-API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to control the agent execution structure and behaviour.<!--more--> The API is written with [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) for including in existing [Servlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet) structure. The component is written as a single addon for our AgentSpeak(L++) agents and can be found in an own [repository](https://github.com/LightJason/REST)
